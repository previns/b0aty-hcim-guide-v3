/**
 * A vertical column that is never wider than the viewport showing it.
 *
 * <p>Without {@link #getScrollableTracksViewportWidth()}, a scroll pane sizes
 * its content to the content's preferred width. One long unbreakable token in
 * one step -- a URL, say -- makes that preferred width exceed the sidebar, and
 * because the horizontal scrollbar is disabled the surplus is simply clipped,
 * taking the right-hand edge of every other row with it.
 *
 * <p>Tracking the viewport width instead means the column is always exactly as
 * wide as the space available, and the wrapping text inside reflows to fit.
